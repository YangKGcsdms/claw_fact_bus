| Aging interval | 30s | Reasonable wait before priority boost |
| Aging floor | Priority 1 (HIGH) | CRITICAL reserved for genuine emergencies |
| Fact TTL default | 300s | 5 minutes, sufficient for most tasks |

## Arbitration Scoring

```
score = (capability_overlap × 10 + domain_overlap × 5 + type_hit × 3)
        × reliability_score
```

Tiebreaker order: score → reliability_score → claw_id (lexicographic).

This formula weights capability match highest because it represents the strongest
signal of fitness. Domain overlap is secondary context, and type pattern hit
is the weakest signal (broadest match).

## Reliability Score Mapping

`reliability_score` is derived from a claw's Transmit Error Counter (TEC), which
maps directly to the claw's state machine thresholds:

| TEC Range | Claw State | reliability_score |
|-----------|:----------:|:-----------------:|
| 0 – 127 | ACTIVE | 1.0 |
| 128 – 255 | DEGRADED | 0.5 |
| ≥ 256 | ISOLATED | 0.0 |

This step function is recommended because it aligns exactly with the claw state
machine boundaries defined in the Fault Confinement extension, making the mapping
easy to verify and reproduce across implementations. An isolated claw scores 0.0
and cannot win exclusive arbitration; a degraded claw competes at half weight.

## TEC Adjustment Rules

| Event | TEC Δ |
|-------|:-----:|
| Fact contradicted | +8 |
| Schema validation failure | +8 |
| Fact expired unresolved | +2 |
| Rate limit exceeded | +1 |
| Fact corroborated | -1 |
| Fact resolved | -1 |
| Heartbeat OK | -1 |

## Content Hash Computation

The `content_hash` field covers the **complete canonical immutable record**, not
just the payload. This ensures tamper detection for all publisher-set fields,
including `fact_type`, `mode`, `priority`, and causation metadata.

### Canonical immutable record

The canonical record for hashing consists of the following fields, with optional
fields included **only when present** (non-null, non-empty):

```python
canonical_record = {
    "fact_type":       fact.fact_type,
    "payload":         fact.payload,          # raw dict, not re-serialised
    "source_claw_id":  fact.source_claw_id,
    "created_at":      fact.created_at,
    "mode":            fact.mode,
    "priority":        fact.priority,
    "ttl_seconds":     fact.ttl_seconds,
    "causation_depth": fact.causation_depth,
}

# Include only when set by publisher
if fact.parent_fact_id:
    canonical_record["parent_fact_id"] = fact.parent_fact_id
if fact.confidence is not None:
    canonical_record["confidence"] = fact.confidence
if fact.domain_tags:
    canonical_record["domain_tags"] = sorted(fact.domain_tags)
if fact.need_capabilities:
    canonical_record["need_capabilities"] = sorted(fact.need_capabilities)
```

> `fact_id` is **excluded** from the canonical record because it may be
> bus-assigned after the publisher constructs the fact. If a publisher
> pre-generates `fact_id`, they SHOULD include it in their own integrity
> checks, but it is NOT part of the cross-implementation canonical record.

### Hash computation

```python
canonical = json.dumps(canonical_record, sort_keys=True, ensure_ascii=False)
content_hash = sha256(canonical.encode()).hexdigest()
```

List-type optional fields (`domain_tags`, `need_capabilities`) are sorted before
serialisation to ensure order-independent hashing.

## Bus Signature (Authority Stamp)

```python
message = f"{fact_id}|{content_hash}|{source_claw_id}|{fact_type}|{created_at}"
signature = hmac_sha256(bus_secret, message)
```

The signature proves a fact was verified and accepted by a specific bus instance.
It is NOT part of the core protocol — it is an implementation-level integrity feature.

## Persistence

The reference implementation uses an append-only JSONL fact store:
- Each event (publish, claim, resolve, dead, corroborate, contradict) is one line
- Periodic compaction removes entries for facts no longer in memory
- Recovery on startup replays the log to reconstruct in-memory state

### Tail corruption handling

Append-only logs can be left with a partial final line if the process is killed
mid-write (e.g. OOM kill, disk full, power loss). On startup recovery, the
implementation SHOULD apply the following policy:

1. Read the log line by line using a streaming parser.
2. Skip any line that fails JSON parsing (log a warning with the byte offset).
3. Accept only lines that deserialise into a recognised event schema.
4. After recovery, truncate the file to the last successfully parsed byte
   boundary before appending new events (prevents re-reading corrupt bytes
   on the next restart).

Compaction MUST use a temporary file and atomic rename (`os.replace`) to
prevent a partial compaction from corrupting the primary log.
